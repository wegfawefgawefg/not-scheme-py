So, what's next? We have a solid foundation. Here are a few directions we could go, building on what we have:

    Refine QuoteNode Code Generation:
        Currently, our code generator pushes simplified representations for quoted expressions (like Python tuples for lists, or specially formatted strings for symbols). For true Lisp-like behavior where 'foo results in a distinct symbol type and '(a b) results in a list of such symbols (not just strings), we'd need to:
            Potentially introduce a Symbol type in the VM (distinct from strings used for variable names).
            Add VM opcodes like PUSH_LITERAL_SYMBOL <name> and MAKE_LITERAL_LIST <count>.
            Update the code generator for QuoteNode to use these new opcodes.
        This would make quoted data more "first-class" and usable for metaprogramming or data manipulation in a way that's idiomatic to Lisp.

    Standard Library Implementation - Phase 1 (Core Primitives):
        We've listed core functions like list, cons, first, rest, is_nil, etc.
        Many of these will require direct VM opcodes and corresponding handlers in codegen.py (similar to how we handled +, print, etc.). For example, (list 1 2) would need to push 1, push 2, then an opcode like MAKE_LIST 2.
        This would make the language much more practical for writing list-processing functions.

        However at the moment it isnt a priority to have a built out standard library. Library code can be implemented in ns itself and supplement all these features. 

    Full use Statement Implementation (Module Loading):
        Currently, _generate_use_node is a placeholder.
        Implementing this fully involves the compiler driver (run_notscheme.py or a new script) being able to:
            Locate the specified module file.
            Lex, parse, and (partially or fully) compile that module.
            Extract its public definitions (symbols, function labels, struct info).
            Make these available to the CodeGenerator for the module currently being compiled.
        This is a larger architectural piece.

    More Language Features:
        Enums: Define syntax, AST node, parser rule, codegen, and VM representation.
        More Loop Constructs: A for-each loop for lists, or a Scheme-like do loop.

Given the current state, I'd suggest Standard Library Implementation - Phase 1 (Core Primitives), focusing on list manipulation functions (list, cons, first, rest, is_nil). This would make NotScheme significantly more expressive and allow us to write more interesting test programs. It also directly builds upon the VM and codegen infrastructure we have.

Refining QuoteNode is also important for Lisp purity, but having basic list operations might be more immediately useful.
